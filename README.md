JalRakshak AI  JalRakshak AI is an early warning system prototype designed to identify drought risk in Saurashtra region. 

Problem: Farmers and local authorities usually get drought information very late, after water scarcity has already started.  
Solution: This system analyzes rainfall, groundwater and weather data to show drought risk levels (Low, Medium, High) in advance.  
Approach: Currently the prototype uses a simple rule-based logic to simulate AI decision making. This helps in validating feasibility and data flow.  
Future Scope: In future, machine learning models can be added for more accurate predictions and automation.
